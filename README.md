# Java implementation of Sparse Vector Quantization

Just a quick version of VQ in Java tested in isolation, to be imported in another project.
I want it to use Sparse Code rules to train the centroids and to code inputs.
The objective is Compressed Sensing, with online training to retain trace of what passes through the compressor.

Stay tuned.
